# Cryptography

## Why to learn Cryptography ðŸ¤”

1)Cryptography is a method to encrypt and decrypt the data. Sometimes we need to send or receive the data in an encrypted format. i.e Not easily recognizable. At that time some methods can encrypt the data. And it must be decrypted to see it as it was. Cryptography is nothing but the science of using or discovering the encrypting and decrypting techniques.
If you changed data in a predictable way, then you'll end up with a code that can be reconstructed into the original data, but the average person might not be able to decipher it.
It's used in computer systems to keep private information and some wireless transmissions secure, and it can be quite complicated.

2)Itâ€™s useful! Cryptography is vital to communication today. In an ideal world, when you log into Facebook only Facebook and you see that username and password: no eavesdroppers. This is accomplished via various cryptographic primitives.
